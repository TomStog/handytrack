# HandyTrack

HandyTrack is a Python-based system for real-time hand detection and tracking using Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries. The system uses a machine learning-based approach to detect hands in a video stream/webcam stream and draw landmarks on one hand at a time and a bounding box around it. HandyTrack is able to perform hand detection and tracking to a webcam/video stream or a webcam/video screenshot as well.
